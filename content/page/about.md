I am Sudarshan, PhD candidate at [University of Tennessee](https://utk.edu/) (UTK) in the [Electrical Engineering & Computer Science](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/) (EECS) department. My interests are in deep learning, natural language processing, and healthcare AI. I am part of [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/) (ORNL) where I work on the Open Source Lab project.

For my PhD work, I am focusing on efficiently mining electronic health records (EHR) for medical representation and utilizing them for building better downstream applications. In particular, my objective is to devise mechanisms that can effectively integrate multi-modal data sources (for example, tabular data, unstructured clinical notes, images) using deep learning techqniues to build end-to-end medical AI applications such as mortality prediction, probability of re-admission, length of hospital stay etc.

I am advised by [Dr. Gregory Peterson](https://www.eecs.utk.edu/people/faculty/gdp/) from UTK and [Dr. Edmon Begoli](https://www.ornl.gov/staff-profile/edmon-begoli) from ORNL.

I am also a student of the deep learning MOOC [FastAI](fast.ai). A lot of my ideas and knowledge came from taking the courses offered by them, so I sincerely recommend others interested in deep learning and machine learning take those courses.
